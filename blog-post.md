# Understanding LSTM: A Solution to Short-Term Memory Issues in RNNs

Have you ever watched the movie "Memento" or its Bollywood adaptation "Ghajni"? If you have, you'll recall how the protagonists struggle with short-term memory loss. Traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) face a similar issue. They struggle to remember information from earlier in the sequence, which hampers their performance in tasks requiring long-term dependencies. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a special type of RNN, solve this problem. In this blog post, we'll break down LSTMs using real-life examples to make the concept easy to grasp.

## Introduction to LSTM

Imagine you have a natural language processing (NLP) task like sentence completion. The prediction of the next word in a sentence depends on the words that came before it. For instance, consider these two sentences:

1. "I need to take a loan."
2. "I had to take a loan."

The choice between "need" and "had" depends on the context provided by the earlier words in the sentence. Traditional RNNs struggle with this kind of task because they suffer from short-term memory issues due to the vanishing gradient problem. This is where LSTMs come into play. LSTMs are designed to retain information for long periods, making them ideal for tasks that require long-term memory.

## Traditional RNNs: A Brief Overview

A traditional RNN processes a sequence of words one by one. For example, in the sentence "Today is a sunny day," the RNN processes "Today" first, learns some weights, and then moves on to "is," and so on. If you unroll an RNN in time, it appears as though it has many layers, but in reality, it has only one layer represented at different time steps (t1, t2, t3).

The problem arises when the RNN tries to predict a word that depends on information from the beginning of the sentence. Due to the vanishing gradient problem, traditional RNNs forget earlier words and focus only on the most recent ones. This short-term memory issue makes them unsuitable for tasks that require understanding of the entire sentence.

## How LSTMs Work

LSTMs introduce a sophisticated mechanism to retain information over long periods. Let's break down the components of an LSTM cell:

### 1. Forget Gate

The forget gate decides what information to discard from the previous cell state. For example, if the sentence moves from discussing "samosa" to "pasta," the forget gate discards the memory of "samosa." It takes the previous hidden state and the current word as inputs, applies a sigmoid function, and outputs a vector of values between 0 and 1. Values close to 0 mean forgetting the information, while values close to 1 mean retaining it.

### 2. Input Gate

The input gate decides what new information to add to the cell state. When "pasta" appears, the input gate adds this new information to the memory. It uses a combination of sigmoid and tanh functions to decide which parts of the new information are important to keep.

### 3. Output Gate

The output gate determines what part of the cell state to output. It uses the current hidden state and the new word as inputs, applies a sigmoid function, and decides what information to pass to the next cell.

### Step-by-Step LSTM Process

1. **Input Processing**: The current word and the previous hidden state are processed through the forget gate to decide what to discard.
2. **Memory Update**: The input gate updates the cell state with new information.
3. **Output Generation**: The output gate generates the output based on the updated cell state.

## Conclusion

LSTM networks are powerful tools for tasks that require long-term memory, such as sentence completion, named entity recognition, and more. By using gates to control the flow of information, LSTMs can retain important information over long periods, making them far more effective than traditional RNNs for certain tasks.
